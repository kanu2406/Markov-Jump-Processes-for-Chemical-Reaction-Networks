# Markov Jump Processes for Chemical Reaction Networks

This Project was done as a part of course on "Markov Processes" during M1 Applied Mathematics and Statistics.This project explores **Markov Jump Processes (MJP)** as a method for modeling **chemical reaction networks**. 
## Project Overview

 In a chemical reaction network, molecules undergo stochastic transitions between reactants and products according to reaction rates. This behavior can be mathematically described using the principles of Markov jump processes, where the state of the system represents the configuration of chemical species present at any given time. The transitions between states occur randomly and depend on the probabilities associated with individual reactions.
The major steps in this project include:
- **Introduction to MJP**: How Markov Jump Processes can model chemical reactions.
- **Mathematical Framework**: Deriving the steady-state solutions for specific chemical reaction networks.
- **Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process**: Integrating non-homogeneous Poisson processes to represent varying reaction rates over time.
- **Simulation Challenges**: Identifying the difficulties of calculating the infinitesimal generator matrix due to time-dependent reaction rates.
- **Numerical Validation**: Simulating the system and comparing results with theoretical expectations.
